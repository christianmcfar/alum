<!--
Laurier students need to know if they have enough credit to graduate. The student enters his program 
(say, Computer Science) and the calendar year he wants to graduate from, and the courses he has taken. 
The app will tell the student if he has enough credit to graduate, if not, the app will tell him what 
credit he lacks (such as half a credit in a non-science subject).
